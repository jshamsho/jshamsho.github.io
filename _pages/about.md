Hello! My name is John Shamshoian and I am a sixth year Ph.D candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://biostat.ucla.edu). My advisor is [Dr. Donatello Telesca](http://donatello-telesca.com). Prior to joining UCLA I graduated with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics from Cal Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo in 2015.

My research centers on developing probabilistic characterizations of functional data analysis methods. The Bayesian paradigm offers a straightforward mechanism for uncertainty quantification, while incorporating key regularization strategies not possible with empirical frameworks. My research finds applications in brain imaging studies and I work closely with the [Jeste Neurodevelopmental Neurophysiology Lab](http://jestelab.org) at UCLA.
